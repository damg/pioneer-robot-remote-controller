  This software provides remote control of the Pioneer robot over a
network using the UDP protocol. You have to install the ARIA library,
protocol.py and server.py on the robot in order to make it to receive
your messages while the client requires pygame, protocol.py and
client.py to run.

The server runs on port 45454 by default, you can change it via a
command line option. To run the client, specify the address of robot
on the command line. After the client started, it will instantly try
to build up a connection and to forward the joystick/keyboard
information.

You may control the robot via joystick - the Y axis defines the
throttle while the X axis rotation speed, you can also use keyboard
controls with arrow keys and SPACEBAR to reset the control information
to (0,0).
